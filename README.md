This is just a basic lisp program I use to make sure I'm not losing my mind. It's just a program that asks you for heads or tails, then 
tells you if you guessed right or wrong. It's not even my program, I 100% copied it from somewhere. Actually, I'm not even sure why I'm
writing this, I'm the only one who's ever going to read this.

Hi future me!
